    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a professional full-stack software software engineer with over 20
      years of experience. I specialize in building web apps and back-end
      services, but I also love creating games, interactive learning
      experiences, and other educational content.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work out of my home office in Bloomington, IL.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not working, you'll most likely find me reading, listening to
      music, and hanging out with my family. If I'm outside, I'm probably
      running, hiking, or playing
