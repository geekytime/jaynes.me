    <h1>My Engineering Philosophy</h1>
    <p>
      I am a huge fan of <b>code quality</b>, supported by a shared style guide,
      meaningful peer reviews, and a pragmatic testing mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in <b>continuous delivery</b>, enabled primarily by automated
      tests and automated deployments, and further supported by tools like
      feature toggles and crash reporting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also believe in <b>continuous discovery</b>. We are far more likely to
      deliver solutions that people love when we take the time to listen to our
      customers, and build a detailed understanding of the problem space.
